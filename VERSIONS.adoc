== Version A-02-20150214

Main improvements: Most of the basic file words are implemented
(only `read-line` still waits); source block files work: the
system boots from disk, not from tape; circular string buffer.

- Added: `defer!`, `defer@`.
- Added: `alias`.

- Added: `delete-file`.
- Modified: Now block files support is optional, by conditional compilation.
- Added: `write-file`.
- Added: `rdrop`.
- Added: `write-line`, `read-file`, `open-file`.
- Modified: `token` renamed to `parse-name`, after Gforth and Forth 2012.
- Added: `file-id`.
- Added: `reposition-file`, `abandon-file`, `headed`, `file-size`.
- Added: `read-byte`, `write-byte`.
- Removed: `filetype?`.
- Added: `filetype`.
- Modified: `zbuf` renamed to `filename-buffers`.
- Modified: `lastfile` renamed to `last-filename`.
- Removed: `.lastfile`.
- Modified: `>fname`renamed to `>filename-buffer`.
- Added: `rename-file`.
- Modified: Faster `+string`.
- Added: `control>bl`.
- Added: Block files can be opened and loaded.
- Added: Circular string buffer.
- Modified: No TAP file required anymore: now the system boots from disk.

== Version A-03-20150219

Main improvement: `read-line`.

- Modified: `(name)` and `n>count` converted to `name>string` (after Gforth and Forth-2012).
- Removed: `>ior`.
- Modified: `(read-file)` renamed to `page-read-file`.
- Modified: `(write-file)` renamed to `page-write-file`.
- Fixed: +3DOS errors are changed to negative (range -1000..-1036, with additions from -1100).
- Added: `read-line`.

== Version 0.4.0 (under development)

- Added: `char-`
- Modified: `>filename-buffer` is substituted by `>filename`, which returns
  the string ready to be used by +3DOS and uses the circular string
  buffer when available.
- Added: `?exit`, after Gforth.
- Fixed: Faster and simpler `control>bl`: all control characters are
  converted to spaces.
- Added: `eof?`, needed to make `file-read` standard.
- Added: `flush-drive`
- Added: `basic-file-header`
- Added: `idedos?`
