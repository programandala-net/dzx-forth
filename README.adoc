== Description

DZX-Forth is an Forth system under development for
http://www.worldofspectrum.org/zxplus3e[ZX Spectrum +3e].

Home page: http://programandala.net/en.program.dzx-forth.html

== Origin

DZX-Forth was forked from http://dxforth.netbay.com.au/[CP/M DX-Forth]
a Forth-94 system for 8088 CP/M.

The fork was done from DX-Forth 4.00, but some changes and fixes from
versions 4.09, 4.10 and 4.11 were incorporated later into DZX-Forth.

== Status

DZX-Forth is a sleeping project. It was developed from 2014-12-30 to
2015-05-20.

DZX-Forth is not finished but it's usable.

A Git repository was created on 2016-03-21 from the development
backups, in order to preserve the evolution of the sources and make
future development easier.

Some code from DZX-Forth has been reused in
http://programandala.net/en.program.solo_forth.html[Solo Forth], a
DTCfootnote:[Direct Threaded Code.] Forth system under active
development for ZX Spectrum 128 and G+DOS.

See the latest version of DZX-Forth for more details.
